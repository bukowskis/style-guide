# style-guide
This repository contains a bunch of lint and style guide files, that 
combined with the correct tool can help you get your code in shape.

## Installation
You need to symlink in the files at the correct places in your project structure.
For example, the `rubocop.yml` file should be symlinked in to your project root as a 
dot-file, i.e. renamed to `.rubocop.yml`.
