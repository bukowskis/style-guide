  # We agree that it is better for the eye to see 0.4 instead of just .4
  # So much so, that we enforce the leading zero to be used.
  LeadingZero:
    style: include_zero

  # It would be chaotic to allow attributes to be sorted arbitrarily.
  # Concentric makes sense, because it focuses on importance of the attribute.
  PropertySortOrder:
    order: concentric

  # This enables us to use underscores in BEM-style classes
  SelectorFormat:
    enabled: false

  # We enforce single quotes in rubocop, and it's the default in scss-lint
  # This overrides the double quote default in hounds' config file
  StringQuotes:
    enabled: true
    style: single_quotes
