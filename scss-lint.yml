  # We agree that it is better for the eye to see 0.4 instead of just .4
  # So much so, that we enforce the leading zero to be used.
  LeadingZero:
    style: include_zero

  # Disabled because hound uses an old version of scss-lint (0.38)
  # whereas pronto uses the newer scss_lint and they can't be made to
  # agree when this property is enabled.
  PropertySortOrder:
    enabled: false

  # This enables us to use underscores in BEM-style classes

  # We enforce single quotes in rubocop, and it's the default in scss-lint
  # This overrides the double quote default in hounds' config file
